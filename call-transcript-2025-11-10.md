## Raw Transcript

Matter. Fred, how you doing? You good mate? Yeah, good mate. Thank you. Fred Oliver,
Bailey's just coming in on what's up? Alright, it's in the back of the socket. Probably. Don't worry, mate, we're on now. So sorry about that. I just wanted to quickly go through Donna, not go through her, go through with her and and just get, just get like another sounding board, I guess, on what we need. So the CRM is essentially a sales and record keeping document or software base, so it's got to hold client details. In fact, let me go into a little bit more detail than that, so and the client details. So, in other words, the business, the contact, and then it will need some sort of security stuff, like what they call CIS So customer information sheet, which they tend to use in banking. And then, in an ideal world, which would be a handy thing later on, the ability to verify that client, a bit like x or whatever, where you you know, if they're a decent client, and we're successful with them and they play ball, then we have the ability to almost, like, grade them, and maybe even let ai do that based on certain qualifiers. You know, whether that's the fact that they've given us all their documents, or whether the fact that we've had a couple of deals go well with them or go bad with them, that type of stuff, details of any requirements we get from them. So we do three different types of three main different types of trading, which are buying and selling of crypto, buying and selling a gold and these banking deals, so you wouldn't need to know it. You wouldn't need to know all of the banking terms, because we can put that in manually, I guess. And they're saying that get a drop down. You'd probably if we got into banking, we'd probably get, you know, like, right? You'd have a requirement, and then you'd have a drop down of exactly which type of file it was, whether it was an empty 103, whether it was a treasury bond or whatever. And we could give you all of that data. You know what it means. The once you've got that those bits, what we'd like to be able to do anytime after that is Paul, if we ask for because we want, probably want to be able to split it into sectors, so the gold, the coins, and the bank and the banking be able to say, well, I want to see all of the crypto clients, or all of the crypto sellers, or all of the crypto deals. Because if somebody else comes in and you want them to get on with some selling you want, and you say, right, you're going to be doing crypto. You want to be able to say to them, just pull off the all of the existing crypto deals that are sat there and have a pop up, because they're effectively what we'll have the deals will effectively be like our whiteboards, because we have whiteboards that we work from at the moment. So it really is just Client Details, details of requirements, little reports that can that can be pulled from the data that we've already put in storage of wallets, confidential information like that, and the ability with the crypto wallet addresses, to be able to put one in and do a search and see if it comes up as a dodgy one. So I guess what will happen is we'll put the wallet addresses in in the first instance, if it comes up as a dodgy one, we'll flag it, and then it can just cross reference, yeah. And then when we do a deal in a year's time, we'll put that wallet in. Because, fine, it's the wallets do the rounds. Quite interesting that I think they pull them off the internet and they say, oh, yeah, I own these 50,000 coins. And they put they give you a wallet address, but they either don't own it, or it's a chunky wallet or whatever. So the ability to do a search on that and find out if it's one of the wallets that shows up that we've already been dealing with and is either good or bad, we want it to basically say, right, we've checked this, and it's either good or bad in the future, we'd like the ability to be the pay master for the deals. So let's assume it's a crypto deal. What happens is there's three or 4% commission on it, and that goes to various different people. So what we would need to do is name those people. You tend to find this, what they call a mandate directly under the buyer, a mandate directly under the seller, who are effectively direct contact. They're slightly higher up in the pecking order, and they get, if it says 4% commission. Generally, what would happen is those two on one on each side would get one and a half percent, and 1% would go to the intermediaries. But if we could list all of those people, we could put the split on there, then we could accept, say it's, for example, it was in crypto, so we were paid comms in usdt we could bring it in. It would, it would show what each person is getting and allow us to send it from there as well. Okay, I forgot wallet storage. Oh, documents as well. So we'd like some automated documents. We've only got like five documents. So what we tend to do is, if we take details of a booking, a requirement, whether it's crypto banking, whatever, we will put certain data in, and we want to pump that out so that that form can go to the person electronically for them to sign a return that stops us chasing our tail later on when They say, No, that's not what I said. So one, one can go to the buying side, one will go to the seller side, a set of terms, a comms agreement, which basically says, right, okay, we're doing this deal, and this is what everyone's agreed and then an NC, NDA, so all those.

**Oliver:** Sorry, and you've already got those.

**Fred:** We'll have those. We'll have those.

**Oliver:** And can I just ask a question, what you mean about like the wallet storage?

**Fred:** What happened is, John Smith will say, I want to buy a load of coins. And we say, no problem. We go to a seller and he says, yeah, no problem. What happens then is, as part of the procedures, which is another thing we'll need, we need to be able to store each each clients or each procedures wrapping around that one deal on the requirements will need. And basically they say things like, right, okay, we want to see your wallet, and we want you to send 10 quid so that we can see it happen on the blockchain and things like that. So when we're able to collect these wallets, these wallet addresses, as part of the agreement, we'll log them on an Excel type thing or against that deal. We'll just have a section in there where we can cut and paste it. Then we'll effectively, slowly build up a database of wallets that have been used in deals. Okay, if a deal goes badly wrong on us, because it turns out the coins were stolen, or the client was a nightmare, whatever wallet is being shot, okay, got it later on, we can just type that in, do it and do a facility where it just says, wallet search. We put it in, and then it will flat, yeah, green, red, or whatever, yeah, yeah.

**Oliver:** So fine. This is totally going to be a work in progress. Yeah? Totally understand that it's different to what you normally do, because it's not like a full band sales version. And I guess it'll have some improvements as we go as well. Yeah, but that's not a problem

**Jacob:** That, yes, it's a case of getting it to a working product which is usable, and then just building as we go. So we start with the basic frameworks of it, getting it to a point where you can use it for day to day, and then it's as things go on, because, like, I'm sure there's things that we've that you've addressed there, which are more of a priority right now than others.

**Fred:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, so basically, to start with, we just need client details, including decision maker and any ID and Docs, like verification docs, so just usual sort of DD on a KYC, the contract details, so the requirement, the ability to send forms out from The data that will be on the system. And then storage of certain documents, I mean, things like the pay master bit and that can be added after, yeah, um, we could do with the reports, to be honest, if we're going to do it and go in phases. Those are sort of the bits really, the ability to know who the client is, what their requirement is, the details of that requirement and the ability to make notes on what you've done for that deal, just typical sales stuff, really

**Jacob:** So, and how are these? How is the contact leading up until like that lead comes in? Is that manually being entered in at the moment by you? Is that sending form or

**Fred:** We don't do that at the moment. So and the and typically the industry doesn't either. But if we're going to build this to scale going forward, then we need to, we want to break the we want to break the mold. Really. We want to be doing stuff that nobody else is doing. Okay? So we'll have a CRM that records all clients, all decision makers details of any deals successful or dead. We can. We want to be able to dead a deal if it didn't work, or gray a deal if it's not done, but we're not doing anything moment. We might even choose to prioritize deals after a while, but not yet, will it. Let's do that for another day. So it is literally client details and the ability to store documents against that verification documents, details of any requirements, the ability to split those out, you know, whether it's old, whatever we can, and we can have a drop down for that, and then details of what we've done on the on those contracts, yeah.

**Jacob:** How do you get, how do you get leads at the minute, where do they arrive from

**Fred:** Networking, to be honest, we, we don't, you're speaking to someone, and they give. We don't ever really do any sales that. There is a massive glut of this, because nobody's doing it, particularly so we don't struggle for the work. I mean, going forward, if you wanted to scale it, maybe you could put some sort of sales function in.

**Jacob:** No, it's more. It's more that there's the structure of the day when it comes in. So your first contact is usually either you literally talking to someone face to face. You give them the number. They call you next day. You tell them what's involved. They say, Yeah, I'm in. And then they send you an email with what you've asked for. Sort of,

**Fred:** Yeah, sort of, I mean, what happens is, say, John, one of our contacts, says, Oh, actually, I've got someone who wants to speak to you. He wants to buy a load of coins. Puts him in touch with us. We speak to him, take some details from him, take some details of what he's looking for as well, and tell him where. And then what we'll do is we'll say, right? We'll go off and and have a look and see which one of our clients we can match you up with. Okay?

**Jacob:** Because I think for us, it's just understanding how we're going to plug that into the CRM. Is that when, when manual adding, isn't it? So you're literally saying, so what would work for you is literally create new contact. You know, simplified down, yeah, it all in by hand. You can type it in, and then, boom, you've got and then you want to be able to add whatever you need, your documents, your searches, everything like that, to that contact. But the initial adding is just manual.

**Fred:** It will be by client, because, you know, normally you go, right, okay, it's Balfour Beatty, and the contact is John Smith, yeah, this is more contact LED. So it's almost a case if John Smith, oh, what's the name of his business, right? Okay, it's John Smith, broker and limited, right? Okay, fine. Nick, we've got any details that we can go on Companies House and find them all in but the truth is, 99% of them, literally, are not English. So, so it'll be client LED. You could actually even have, you need to sort of say where that source was as well, because those people will end up somehow in the Consulate. Yeah, John's John Smith. He's got John Smith brokers. He came via Jim, yeah, okay, and, and this is, this is as much as we know about at the moment, this thing called CIS we could, we could do with having the ability to store that document and then maybe manually pull off details from it to add into his client details, if you like, because what do is a document that says, I'm John, I've got John Smith broken here's my bank details, here's my ID and all those sorts of bits and pieces. So I'll be decision maker, his organization, the requirement he's got from a drop down. Because the the types of requirements will the drop down will help, because the types of requirements will be how they're set up on the CRM will be different depending on whether it's gold banking or coins. If it's coins, you know, there's obviously the details are one way. If it's gold, it's completely different. So what we would need is hit that, drop down. It opens up, yeah, waiting to be filled in. You know, the questions to be filled in?

**Jacob:** Okay, cool, yeah, agree. I think everything you said is doable for sure, just going to take a bit of planning and work and working out. Do you have anything external, just so I can have a little look just familiar around myself? Do you have a website or anything like that? Or do you have

**Fred:** Not on, not for this one? No, okay, that's fine.

**Jacob:** I Are you planning on getting one?

**Fred:** No, yeah, we need to get one done. We,

**Jacob:** But we, we build websites, yeah, Oliver show, get one. I can do it. Which one? Just maybe, I don't know, maybe the green star one, because a bit more modern, and you do the there's one we've just done. Yeah, this one, this is one we've just done nice and models. Got a nice hover effect over it. Pretty cool, really? Yeah, the background sort of moves with when you scroll in there. Nice and modern. Everything's cool. You got details here. These could be service cards, for example. For you guys, this could be gold on the back. Could ask you, could, you know, give whatever details you want to say about what's involved and things like that. But this is one we did for a solar company recently, so we could do something like this for you.

**Jacob:** This one was actually, I don't know what they ended up paying in the end, because we have the JJ, I'll be able to tell you better. But it was about two and a half grand. And then whatever we charge for the widget, which is not my part of the Yeah,

**Oliver:** And two and off the website, but then they had the widget and the database reactivation service, and that was an extra 1000 pound, but then a monthly cost on top of that. But we'll sort, I'll sort you out. This is the DBR thing that he was talking about. But yeah, these are, these are secondary to what we're talking about anyway. But yeah, interesting. And it's no, it's no problem either. But yeah, okay, okay. There's going to be some things. There's going to be a few back and forth to start with, like, obviously, for example, you were just explaining about the different requirements for each service. That's going to be something that needs to be laid out so we can understand exactly what is required. I'll send you some questions. There might be a few to start with, but, you know, Whatsapp group now. Fred, yeah, okay, mate,

**Jacob:** General cost for the basic

**Oliver:** I'll be able to tell you by the end of the day, maybe, but I just It depends what's involved and how. Yeah, I mean, so

**Fred:** Just to get the client detail bit with the ability to store and all of that. The requirement, you know, the storage of the requirements, the ability to split out the jobs by industry, wallet storage and forms, okay?

**Oliver:** Well, leave that we've been I'll go and put something together and see what I need a more information and what's

**Fred:** The company called Fred, the opportunity broker, cool,

**Oliver:** Right? I've just set up a WhatsApp group, and then anything that we talk about, we just talk about it in there, because then we'll just keep it clean and yeah,

**Jacob:** Is your time frame is ASAP, yeah, as quick as possible. Yeah.

**Fred:** I mean, what? So we've got a couple of deals we're waiting on coming in. If they come in, then we can justify putting a CT and putting a CRM together, you know, because if these couple of deals come in, it will confirm to us that this sector can work, that those deals do happen and that they'll pay for themselves as soon as we've got that. That's confirmation of everything, and it gives us funds as well. And we'll just, and we'll just look to do something.

**Jacob:** So what's our time frame? Are they going to you're going to know about them

**Fred:** This week. Okay, cool, all right,

**Jacob:** Sounds so we'll have a good idea if we're going to idea if we're going to proceed and what it's going to cost. Yeah, okay. I mean, for now, that's

**Fred:** Probably enough, yeah,

**Jacob:** But you've got any questions, obviously, feel free to, you know, feel free to just ping them on there or whatever. No problem. Yeah, cool. That sounds good.

**Oliver:** Not for me. We need, for the moment, that's

**Jacob:** Enough for us to go away and definitely get a bit of framework together for it and just sort of look at timings and and stuff like that as well, like how long this is going to take us, yeah? But, yeah, if we do it in phases and, you know, but we'll come back to you this week. Well, hopefully we'll look at this like this afternoon. Oliver,

**Fred:** Yeah, is it in a way where you can just literally stitch bits on IT facilities?

**Jacob:** It's dynamic, yeah? So whatever state it is, I mean, the way I do things you can Yeah, yeah. There's never going to be a point where it's going to be like, Oh no, that doesn't fit. Because if it doesn't fit, then we just rebuild a bit that doesn't fit. I mean, it's very Yeah, it's very dynamic. Yeah,

**Fred:** That sounds good, right? Then, boys,

**All:** Yeah, you too. Have a good day.
