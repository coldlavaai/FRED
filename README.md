## Notes

- Fred is waiting on 2 deals this week - if they close, project gets greenlit
- No existing website for "The Opportunity Broker" (potential future project)
- Most clients are non-English speakers
- Current process uses whiteboards - CRM will replace this
- Industry doesn't typically use CRMs - Fred wants to "break the mold"
- Reference pricing: Greenstar Solar website ~£2.5k + widget/DBR £1k + monthly

---

## Project Goals

**Primary:**
Replace whiteboard-based deal tracking with professional CRM system

**Secondary:**
- Prevent fraud through wallet address tracking
- Create audit trail for legal protection
- Enable team scaling
- Improve efficiency and reduce admin time
- Provide business intelligence through reporting

**Success Metric:**
Fred can't imagine working without the system once it's live.
